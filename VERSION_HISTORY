v.0.34
- can test also reverse-complement and keep better (for read alignment)
- can do multiple rounds of read placement to find overlap

v.0.33
- query sequence matching equally well to several targets is placed to multiple locations
- alternative scores for choosing the target: default self-normalised substitution score
- the source code now at http://code.google.com/p/pagan-msa/


v.0.32
- option '--454' works also with FASTA-formatted sequences


v.0.31
- option for contig build to show ancestral sequence across gaps
- option to use more appropriate default settings for PacBio pileup


v.0.30
- separation of consensus ancestor reconstruction and contig assembly
- corrected read order in consensus alignment


v.0.29
- preliminary support for contig assembly
- consensus ancestors for (DNA) read alignment


v.0.28
- preliminary support for read pileup using consensus ancestors


v.0.27
- integrated Exonerate to speed up the search for placement nodes


v.0.26
- repaired the broken ancestor reconstruction: now also for codon data.


v.0.25
- bug fix: reads can now also be aligned against tagged leaf nodes.
- added option to search optimal placement among internal only or all nodes.


v.0.24
- added option '--version' to check for updates.


v.0.23
- this is the first version with the complete set of features described in the manuscript.
