%edges for cases where a new follows an existing gap are missing
prank+F like behaviour; should be default?
DONE

add a small penalty for ambiguous characters:
 p(A,A) > p(A,R)
 possibly also
 p(A,R) > p(A,N)
DONE

maybe it's not right to compute post probs and then weight the edges
- remove post prob calculation and use fwd + wieghths vs bwd
  - or there's rounding error; check more accurate log/exp functions (Tim)


instead of passing vector<matrix_pointer> to add_sample_gap_* functions, pass a plain matrix_pointer
- this can be modified (add missing x_ind, y_ind, etc) before pushing to vector
